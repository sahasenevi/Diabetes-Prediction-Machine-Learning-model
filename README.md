I built an end-to-end Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning model using Python in Google Colab to identify whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on key medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other health indicators.

This project covers the complete machine learning lifecycle, starting from data collection and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. Using industry-standard Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, I analyzed patterns in healthcare data, visualized insights, and developed an effective classification model.

Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested and evaluated using accuracy and performance metrics to compare results and understand model behavior. This hands-on project gave me valuable experience in predictive analytics, working with real-world healthcare datasets, and interpreting model outcomes in a meaningful way.

Through this project, I strengthened my foundation in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning fundamentals, while gaining practical exposure to how AI-driven solutions can support early health risk identification and data-informed decision-making.
