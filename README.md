🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning | Python 🤖📊

I built an end-to-end Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning model using Python in Google Colab to identify whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on key medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other health indicators 🧬.

This project covers the complete machine learning lifecycle 🔄 — from data collection and preprocessing 🧹, exploratory data analysis 📈, feature selection 🧠, to model training and performance evaluation ✅. I used industry-standard Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn 🛠️ to analyze healthcare data and extract meaningful insights.

Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested and compared 📊 using accuracy and evaluation metrics to understand model performance and behavior. This hands-on experience strengthened my understanding of predictive analytics 🔮 and working with real-world healthcare datasets.

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in Python programming 🐍, data analysis 📉, and machine learning fundamentals 🤖, while exploring how AI-driven solutions can support early health risk identification and better decision-making 🩻.
